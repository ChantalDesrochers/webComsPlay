# Inserting Custom Styles

User story --> As a developer I want to be able to customize the styling of my Custom Element in the following ways:
- completely overwrite existing styling and create my own stylesheet
- apply a theme to only the custom element itself
- apply a theme to an entire area (which includes the custom element itself)
- tweak internal styles within the custom element

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout to this branch (userInsertedStlye) <-- (yes style is spelt incorrectly)
3. npm install
4. 'npm run start' to start the server
5. Visit http://localhost:8080/
